    <h1>Introduction to Climate Change</h1>
    <p>Climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities have been the primary driver of global warming since the mid-20th century.</p>
    <p>The increase in greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in the atmosphere has led to rising global temperatures, more frequent extreme weather events, and melting ice caps.</p>
